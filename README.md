PHW251B (Data Visualizations for Public Health) at the University of California, Berkeley used R to create data a range of data visualizations (plots, histograms, etc.) while emphasizing the need to create effective graphical designs to communicate health data to the appropriate audiences. Additionally, Power BI, Tableau, and R Shiny were introduced and expanded upon. For the final project, I created an interactive dashboard using R Shiny showing the Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis) cases and incidence rates in California from 2018 - 2022.
